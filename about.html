                        <p>Ghazel Masah is an architect and engineer based in Amsterdam, known for integrating architectural design with computational methods. Trained at TU Delft and with a background in architecture, civil engineering, and construction management, her work focuses on creating sustainable, climate-adaptive architecture. Her approach is rooted in data-driven design, using computational tools to shape buildings that are both visually refined and thermally comfortable. From private homes to community-focused housing, she designs spaces that respond to both people and climate, balancing modern aesthetics with environmental intelligence. Ghazel continues to work part-time as an engineering consultant in the Netherlands while pursuing architecture projects across Southeast Asia. Her thesis, Designing for Comfort, proposes a computational design framework tailored to tropical urban environments.</p>
